<p><h3>About her</h3></p>
</body>
<ol>
    <li>She had a mammory tumor a few years ago that was successfully removed. There was a 10% chance of it being benign and it thankfully was!</li>
    <li>I've had her since I was two, meaning she is 18 years old</li>
    <li>When I'm doing schoolwork, or playing games on my computer, she will paw at my arm until I start petting her.</li>
